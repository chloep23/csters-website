## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chloep23/csters-website.git
cd csters-website
```

Then open the folder in your IDE (e.g. VS Code).

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed (we recommend Node 18+).
[Note: if you run into the crypto.hash is not a function error, make sure npm is version is 10.9.2 and node is version 23.11.0.]

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit the app in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### 4. Create a branch and commit your changes

Always branch off of `main` before making changes:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

Make your edits, then run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change here"
git push origin your-feature-name
```

Then open a pull request to merge into `main`.

---

### 5. Start developing

Edit components inside the `src/` directory that correspond to your page. Tailwind CSS is preconfigured for styling.
